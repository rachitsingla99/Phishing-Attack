# Phishing Attack Analysis and Response

## Introduction
Phishing remains one of the most prevalent cyber threats, where attackers disguise themselves as legitimate entities to steal sensitive information. This project will guide you through the process of detecting, analyzing, and mitigating phishing attacks using real-world techniques and tools.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- A basic understanding of email communication protocols
- Familiarity with common phishing tactics
- Exposure to email forensic tools

## Lab Environment & Required Tools

To effectively investigate phishing emails, a controlled environment with specialized tools is necessary. Below is the setup guide:

### 1. Simulated Email Server
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Establish a local email infrastructure to safely analyze phishing emails without affecting real accounts.
ðŸ›  Tools:
- Halon MTA: A versatile email server platform for security-focused analysis.
- MailCatcher: A lightweight SMTP server to capture and inspect emails.
- Mutt: A command-line email client for UNIX-based systems.

### 2. Collection of Phishing Email Samples
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Gather phishing email examples for hands-on analysis.
ðŸ›  Tools:
- PhishTank: A community-driven repository of phishing threats.
- OpenPhish: A constantly updated database of active phishing URLs.

### 3. Email Examination & Threat Analysis Tools
ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Dissect phishing emails to extract critical information.
ðŸ›  Tools:
- Thunderbird: A feature-rich email client for managing and investigating phishing emails.
- PhishTool: A dedicated platform for analyzing phishing messages.
- Header Analysis Tools: Services like MXToolbox and EmailHeaders.net help interpret email headers for forensic investigation.

 ## Setting Up Your Investigation Environment
### Step 1: Install Thunderbird
- Download and install Thunderbird from the [official website](https://www.thunderbird.net/).
- Configure an email account using either a real or simulated server.

### 2. Set Up Email Server Simulation
- Install MailCatcher: 
  ```sh
  gem install mailcatcher
  mailcatcher
Access MailCatcher at http://127.0.0.1:1080/ to view captured emails.

### Step 3: Import Phishing Emails
- Retrieve phishing samples from PhishTank or OpenPhish.
- Load them into Thunderbird for analysis.
### Step 4: Configure PhishTool for Analysis
- Sign up for a free account on PhishTool.
- Integrate it with Thunderbird by following the setup guide.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identifying Phishing Emails
**Objective**: Learn to recognize phishing emails based on common characteristics.

**Steps**:
1. Set up your email analysis environment using Thunderbird.
2. Load the provided phishing email samples into Thunderbird.
3. Identify and document common phishing indicators (e.g., suspicious sender address, generic greetings, urgent language, suspicious links).

**Expected Output**:
- A list of identified phishing emails with documented indicators.

### Exercise 2: Analyzing Email Headers
**Objective**: Understand how to analyze email headers to uncover information about the email's origin.

**Steps**:
1. Select a phishing email from Exercise 1.
2. Open the email header information in Thunderbird.
3. Analyze the header to identify:
   - Sender's IP address
   - Email servers the email passed through
   - Any discrepancies in the sender's information

**Expected Output**:
- A detailed report on the email header analysis with identified IP addresses and server information.

### Exercise 3: Investigating Suspicious Links
**Objective**: Learn to investigate suspicious links in phishing emails without compromising your system.

**Steps**:
1. Identify suspicious links in the phishing emails from Exercise 1.
2. Use a URL analysis tool (e.g., VirusTotal, PhishTool) to investigate the links.
3. Document the findings, including the risk level and any associated malicious activity.

**Expected Output**:
- A report detailing the analysis of each suspicious link, including screenshots and risk assessments.

### Exercise 4: Reporting and Documenting the Phishing Attempt
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive report of the phishing investigation.

**Steps**:
1. Compile findings from Exercises 1-3 into a single report.
2. Include the following sections:
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed analysis of phishing emails
   - Email header analysis
   - Suspicious link investigation
   - Recommendations for preventing future phishing attacks
3. Present the report in a clear and professional format.

**Expected Output**:
- A comprehensive phishing investigation report ready for presentation to stakeholders.
